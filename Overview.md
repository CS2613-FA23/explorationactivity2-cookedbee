# üî•Exploration Activity 2üî•

# Question 1‚ú®

   For my exploration activity I chose the three.js 3D animation JavaScript library[1].

# Question 2‚ú®

   ## What is the purpose of this package‚ÅâÔ∏è
   
   It's purpose is to provide programmers with various tools to create and display GPU-accelerated 3D animations in a web browser using WebGL[2].
   The features that it provides are, Effects, Scenes (ex add and remove objects on runtime and fog), Cameras (perspective, fps, etc..), 
   Animation (forward kinematics, morph, etc...), Lights (ambient, direction, etc...), Materials (Lambert, Phong, etc...), Shaders (GLSL capabilities),
   Objects (meshes, particles, etc...), Geometry (plane, cube, etc...), Import/Export (native serialization/deserialization), 
   Utilities (3D math functions like frustum, matrix....), Support, Debugging (three.js inspector), virtual and augmented reality via webXR.
   
   ## How do you use it‚ÅâÔ∏è
   
   First thing you have to do to use this package is install from the npm package regestry via your terminal, there are two things that need to be downloaded 
   in order to use the library. Firstly, you must install the three.js library, to do this simply write into your terminal npm install --save three. Secondly, 
   you must install a build tool, you can download any one of them but vite is recommended, to install it all you have to do is write into your terminal 
   npm install --save-dev vite [3]. Alternatively, you can also import from a CDN, so you would install without build tools This process is much longer
   you would have to put the imports directly into the html code script, you would also need to run a local server to host the files at an URL with the npx serve function written in terminal[3].
   Now you can start using the library, but before you start writing the main JavaScript code you must use a html code encasing (it should be wrapped in the body and script tags) 
   so that the website part works, and if you want the website to have like a different background or more front end features then you just have to ad to the
   html code. Then at the start of the JavaScript code you should write import * as THREE from 'three'; (you can replace 'three' with a link to the libraries you want to use). 
   
# Question 3‚ú®
   
   This library has many functionalities used to create the 3D animations, the ones I utilized were the geometry functions and the animate functions,
   like rotate.

# Question 4‚ú®

   This library was created on April 24, 2023. [4]

# Question 5‚ú®

   I chose this library because I was very interested in what JavaScript had to offer when it came to animation development
   related libraries, and I chose this one in particular because it is quite popular, it has many functionalities, and it is 
   very flexible when it comes to what you can do with it. I wanted to learn more about 3D animation becuase it is a programming
   aspect that I would like to start using more and get good at.

# Question 6‚ú®

   This library influenced my learning of Javascript by teaching me how to use Javascript in the context of web applications, it
   allowed me to learn how to implement html functionalities alongside it. This library also allowed me to realize how many different
   things that you can do with JavaScript. I also allowed me to use many different JavaScript functions that I had never used before 
   which allowed me to explore the documentation in much more depth, I leant alot about the language by doing this.

# Question 7‚ú®

   ## When would I recommend this library to someone‚ÅâÔ∏è

   I would recommend it to someone if they wanted to create 3D animations. This library in particular is very easy to learn, and it
   would be very accessable to someone who has never done 3D animations before. It is very hastle free when it comes to the web 
   application part of the code, this library uses WebGL, which makes everything simpler.

   ## Would you continue to use this library‚ÅâÔ∏è

   Yes personally I will continue using this library because creating 3D animations is very fun with this library, and i would like     to create a game with it someday. I would chose this library over other animation libraries because it is so easy to use, and the 
   creation of the web application is no issue at all.
