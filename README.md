# Question 1

   This program demonstrates the use of the three.js JavaScript 3D animation library [1]

# Question 2

   To run this program you must first install three.js and vite using the npm install command in your teminal. the commands are npm install --save three and
   npm install --save-dev vite[2]. Vite is simply a build tool that is used during development, three is the library being used. Then all that has to be done to
   run my program is download the raw animal.html file to your computer. Then all that you need to do is open the file and it will automatically bring you to 
   the webpage where the animation is located.

   that shows off the main functionalities of the library.

# Question 4
   
   The output is the 3D animated animal on the html webpage.
